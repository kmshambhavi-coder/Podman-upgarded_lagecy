|Use the same approach with event creation for all alert types?|By default connector uses a different approach with Scheduled Alert or NRT types of alerts - it tries to fetch events that caused the alert by running the query specified in alert details.

First attribute will have the highest priority, next if its not present or empty in the event - fallback to the next value from the list and so on. If none of the fallback fields are found, connector will use createdTimeUTC, and if that's also non existent - alert ingestion time to Chronicle SOAR.|True|properties_firstActivityTimeGenerated,properties_startTimeUtc,properties_createdTimeUtc,properties_firstAlertTimeGenerated|
|EndTimeFallback|Specify a comma separated list of incident or alert attributes that should be used as a fallback for the “End Time” alert field in descending order.

First attribute will have the highest priority, next if its not present or empty in the event - fallback to the next value from the list and so on. If none of the fallback fields are found, connector will use createdTimeUTC, and if that's also non existent - alert ingestion time to Chronicle SOAR.|True|properties_lastActivityTimeGenerated,properties_endTimeUtc,properties_createdTimeUtc,properties_lastAlertTimeGenerated|
